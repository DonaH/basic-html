  <h1>About Nicole</h1>


  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>
    Nicole was flung into this world on November 21, many - but not too many - years ago. She grew up in nifty town called Northvale, which lies north west of New York City, in the mighty state of New Jersey. As a tyke, she enjoyed running around, climbing trees, playing in the woods, and generally being a bother. Over time, she calmed down some, learned to love books, and then went through school.

  <h2>Some Time In Between</h2>
    <p>
     After high school, Nicole moved on to college at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. It was there that she learned the virtues of hard work - it didn't come easy, oops - and what it meant to speak, listen, and understand language. She graduated with a major in Communication Disorders, a minor in Spanish, and had no idea what to do with her life. She was advised to become a teacher of the Deaf, and that she did.

   <h2>A Real Grown Up?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, after attending graduate school at Boston University, Nicole enjoyed a fulfilling career as a middle school and then an elementary school teacher at two of Massachusetts Deaf schools. She worked at The Learning Center for the Deaf for five years. Then, she moved on to The Horace Mann School in Boston. In the mean time, Nicole learned the art of Aeiral Hoop and a variety of other circus arts. She even performed in the <a href="http://www.eshcircusarts.com/"> Esh Circus Arts</a> Stduent Showcase in October, 2014. Suddenly, things got weird and she needed to figure out something else to do. So, Nicole decided to go to General Assembly after she moved to Venice, California. What an adventure, indeed.
