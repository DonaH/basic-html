  <h1>Shortcuts I've Learned So Far</h1>

  <h2>Symbols</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The command symbol looks like a flower.</li>
    <li>The control symbol looks like a hat or carrot.</li>
    <li>The shift symbol looks like an arrow pointing up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Shortcuts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Command / (that's a forward slash) comments out something in an html page.</li>
      <li>Command "V" pastes something that has been copied or cut somewhere on a page.</li>
      <li>In Terminal, Control Command "L" clears your screen, but does not delete all of the previous commands you have typed!</li>
      <li>Command Z means undo. If you make a mistake, you can undo it one or more times.</li>
      <li>In Terminal, if you begin typing a word, usually about three letters or characters in, if you stop and hit TAB, it'll auto-fill for you.</li>
    </ul>
